AJAX-ify ExpressionEngine's Built-In Contact Form With JQuery
=======================================

It's great that EE provides a simple and robust contact form. However, as shipped the contact form's interactive presentation is not very modern-- you get temporarily redirected to a separate success page after you've submitted the form, then you get redirected back to your site. This provides a user experience which is not as responsive as I wanted, and didn't match the look and feel of the rest of my site.

This JQuery script will AJAX-ify EE's built-in contact form to give a more snappy, modern and seamless feel that maintains your site's design. The files you see here include the JQuery script as well as a sample EE email contact template based on EE's standard template[http://expressionengine.com/user_guide/modules/email/contact_form.html].

See my blog article[http://www.highintegritydesign.com/blog/articles/creating-a-modern-ajax-contact-form-in-expressionengine] for a complete discussion of how the script works with the template, and how to modify the script for your site. Don't worry, it's not hard! Try it out and let me know how it works for you.
